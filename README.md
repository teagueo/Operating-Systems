Operating Systems Function
	One operating system function is device management. The operating system manages device communication through their drivers. It will keep track of the devices connected to the system, and designates a program for each device. This is the input/output controller. It also manages which process gets access to which device, when and how long. It manages the devices and programs in an effective and efficient way and deallocates devices when they are no longer needed.
	File management is another function of the operating system. A file system is organized into directories for efficiency and easy navigation. The OS keeps track of all the files, locations and access settings for users. This is known as the file system. 
	The OS monitors system health as well, this helps improve performance. It records the response time between service requests and system response for a complete view of system health. This can help improve performance by providing information to troubleshoot problems.
